    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Meat:</strong>This super meaty lasagna has sweet Italian sausage and lean ground beef.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Onion and Garlic: </strong> An onion and two cloves of garlic are cooked with the meat to add tons of flavor.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Tomato Products: </strong> You'll need a can of crushed tomatoes, two cans of tomato sauce, and two cans of tomato paste.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Sugar: </strong> Two tablespoons of white sugar add subtle sweetness and enhance the flavor of the sauce.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Spices and Seasonings: </strong> This lasagna recipe is flavored with fresh parsley, dried basil leaves, salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and black pepper.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Lasagna Noodles: </strong> Use store-bought or homemade lasagna noodles.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Cheeses: </strong> Parmesan, mozzarella, and ricotta cheese make this lasagna extra decadent.
        </li>
        <li>
